<div>Although the past decades have seen significant advances in the phonological study of tonal accent, several fundamental questions remain where no consensus has been reached. Most importantly, this concerns the precise nature of&nbsp; the tonal oppositions observed in surface representation, and their status in underlying forms and in the grammar more generally. We can (roughly) differentiate between two approaches, which we&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>tonal approach</i> and a&nbsp;<i>metrical approach</i>. In the tonal approach, which represents the most widespread account of tonal accent, one of the accents is assumed to carry a lexical tone, while the other accent is lexically toneless (or, more rarely, both accents are assumed to be associated with some lexical tone). More recently, however, metrical alternatives to the tonal approach have been proposed. The general idea is that the tonal contrasts are surface correlates of a more abstract metrical opposition between the accents, such as two different types of feet, the placement of grid marks indicating different locations of metrical prominence, or syllable counts. These diverse structures then affect the association of predictable, post-lexical tones.</div><div>For Franconian, Carlos Gussenhoven and collaborators have proposed to analyze the tone-accent opposition as a privative lexical tone contrast. Their central analytical claim is that Accent 2 has a lexical tone, which then combines with intonational tones on the surface. Accent 1 is the default realization, that is, all tones are intonational.</div><div></div><div>       </div>
