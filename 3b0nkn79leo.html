<div>Although the past decades have seen significant advances in the phonological study of tonal accent, several fundamental questions remain where no consensus has been reached. Most importantly, this concerns the precise nature of&nbsp; the tonal oppositions observed in surface representation, and their status in underlying forms and in the grammar more generally. We can (roughly) differentiate between two approaches, which we will call&nbsp;<i>tonal&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>metrical</i>.</div><div>The tonal approach builds on the ground-breaking advances of Autosegmental Phonology&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Goldsmith1976}</cite>&nbsp;and the autosegmental-metrical approach in general&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Ladd2008}</cite> in the study of both tone and intonation, and is the mainstream account in generative phonology. This analysis derives the difference between the 'accents' from surface-phonological representations containing the same kind of tonal autosegments as are used in the analysis of lexical tone contrasts or of intonational melodies in non-tonal languages. Specifically, the melodies used to implement the pitch-accent contrast are decomposed into sequences of individual tones, whose placement (timing) is then regulated by standard phonological mechanisms. If the melodies are complex, they are analysed as consisting  of some intonational tones (such as focus accents or pitch accents associated with the expression of declarative or interrogative meaning), as well as, crucially, lexical tones associated with the individual morphemes. Most often the analysis is that one of the 'accent classes' is associated with some lexical tone, which then interacts with  intonation, whilst the other one is lexically toneless, carrying only intonational tones. For instance, in Central Swedish tonal accent as analysed by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Riad2014}</cite> the focus declarative melody in 'accent 1' (as in [ˈandɛn] 'the duck') is a rise in the stressed syllable, followed by a fall, analysed in this case as a LHL sequence. 'Accent 2' (as in [ˈandɛn] 'the spirit') shows a rise-fall in the stressed syllable&nbsp;<i>and</i> a second rising-falling pattern in the immediately following syllable; this is analysed as HLHL. That is, 'accent 2' carries an extra H tone, but otherwise the melodies are identical; this follows if the L*H is a focus tone associated with a particular kind of phrasal stress, and the following L% is a boundary tone.</div><div>Comparable tonal analyses have been developed for Franconian, where Carlos Gussenhoven and collaborators have proposed to treat the tonal accent opposition as a privative lexical tone contrast. Their central analytical claim is that Accent 2 inF has a lexical tone, which then combines with intonational tones on the surface. Accent 1 is the default realization, where all tones are intonational. Take Take Cologne Franconian as example:&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Gussenhoven2004}</cite>  and Peters (2006) analyse the system with a lexical tone T<sub>lex</sub> on the first mora of Accent 2. The surface value of T<sub>lex&nbsp;</sub>is determined by the following intonational tone; that is, it always copies the value of that tone. In declaratives, where the intonational pitch accent is H*L, the lexical tone is realized as H<sub>lex</sub> because of the following H*; in interrogatives, where the pitch accent is L*H, it is realized as L<sub>lex</sub>, copying the value of L*. Accordingly, Accent 2 will be realized as H<sub>lex</sub>H*L in declaratives and L<sub>lex</sub>L*H in interrogatives. the first two tones are always realized in the accented syllable; the third tone will occur later in the phrase in phrase-medial position, resulting in a high-level tone in the accent syllable in declaratives (H<sub>lex</sub>H*) and a low-level tone in interrogatives (L<sub>lex</sub>L*), respectively. In phrase-final position, the third tone will be realized at the end of the accent syllable, leading to a late fall (H<sub>lex</sub>H*L)  in declaratives, and a late rise (LlexL*H) in interrogatives. Accent 1, on the other hand, will be purely intonational, with an early fall (H*L) in declaratives and an early rise (L*H) in interrogatives. </div><div>The tonal analysis of accentual oppositions has significant explanatory power. It unifies 'tonal accent' with other prosodic phenomena such as tone and intonation, correctly predicts that the realization of accentual contrasts depends on the intonational context, and makes specific predictions as to the relative markedness of the members of the opposition. On the latter point, for instance, in the Central Swedish case the assumption is that 'accent 2' is the more marked pole of the contrast, since it carries a lexical tone. This is consistent with the fact that when accentual oppositions are neutralized (notably in monosyllables), it is only 'accent 1' that is possible in that language: under common assumptions about markedness, non-assimilatory neutralization of contrast should produce relatively unmarked structures as outputs, confirming 'accent 1' as the less marked option&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Rice,de_Lacy_2006}</cite>.</div>
