<div>Although the past decades have seen significant advances in the phonological study of tonal accent, several fundamental questions remain where no consensus has been reached. Most importantly, this concerns the question of how precisely the tonal surface opposition should be derived. Here, we can (roughly) differentiate between a&nbsp;<i>tonal approach</i> and a&nbsp;<i>metrical approach</i>. In the tonal approach, which represents the most widespread account of tonal accent, one of the accents is assumed to carry a lexical tone, while the other accent is lexically toneless (or, more rarely, both accents are assumed to be associated with some lexical tone). More recently, however, metrical alternatives to the tonal approach have been proposed. The general idea is that the tonal contrasts are surface correlates of a more abstract metrical opposition between the accents, such as two different types of feet, the placement of grid marks indicating different locations of metrical prominence, or syllable counts. These diverse structures then affect the association of predictable, post-lexical tones.</div><div>For Franconian, Carlos Gussenhoven and collaborators h</div><div>                                        </div><div>The ‘traditional’ theoretical approach to the analysis of  tonal accent, proposed in a series of papers by Gussenhoven and collaborators, operates  under the assumption that there is a lexical tone contrast between the two  accents. Accent 2 carries a lexical tone, and Accent 1 is the default. As a  prototypical example, consider the tenets of the tonal analysis of the Cologne  dialect, as provided in Gussenhoven and Peters (2004). The authors assume that Accent  1 is lexically toneless, which means that its surface structure will consist of  intonational tones only. In phrase-medial position, this will be H*L for  declaratives, and L*H for interrogatives. The first tone links to the first  mora of the accent syllable; the second tone goes to the second mora. As shown  in Figure 3 (left side), this leads to a falling contour in declaratives, and a  rising contour in interrogatives.</div><div>    Accent  2, then, <i>has</i> a lexical tone, which is  realized on the first mora of the accent syllable. Since the ideal association  of tones to moras is one-to-one, there is only space for one intonational tone  on the second mora of the accent syllable; this is shown in Figure 3 (right  side); the leftover tone will be realized after the accent syllable. The  lexical tone surfaces as HLex in declaratives and as LLex  in interrogatives. According to Gussenhoven and Peters, the lexical tone  changes its quality because it copies the value of the following intonational  tone. As a consequence, we will get two identical tones in the accent  syllables, which are realized as a high level tone in declaratives, and a low  level tone in interrogatives, respectively.        </div>
