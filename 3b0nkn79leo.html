<div>Although the past decades have seen significant advances in the phonological study of tonal accent, several fundamental questions remain where no consensus has been reached. Most importantly, this concerns the precise nature of&nbsp; the tonal oppositions observed in surface representation, and their status in underlying forms and in the grammar more generally. We can (roughly) differentiate between two approaches, which we will call&nbsp;<i>tonal&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>metrical</i>.</div><div>The tonal approach builds on the ground-breaking advances of Autosegmental Phonology&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Goldsmith1976}</cite>&nbsp;and the autosegmental-metrical approach in general&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Ladd2008}</cite> in the study of both tone and intonation, and is the mainstream account in generative phonology. This analysis derives the difference between the 'accents' from surface-phonological representations containing the same kind of tonal autosegments as are used in the analysis of lexical tone contrasts or of intonational melodies in non-tonal languages. Specifically, the melodies used to implement the pitch-accent contrast are decomposed into sequences of individual tones, whose placement (timing) is then regulated by standard phonological mechanisms. If the melodies are complex, they are analysed as consisting  of some intonational tones (such as focus accents or pitch accents associated with the expression of declarative or interrogative meaning), as well as, crucially, lexical tones associated with the individual morphemes. Most often the analysis is that one of the 'accent classes' is associated with some lexical tone, which then interacts with  intonation, whilst the other one is lexically toneless, carrying only intonational tones. For instance, in the classic analysis of Central Swedish tonal accent by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Bruce1977}</cite>&nbsp;the declarative melody in 'accent 1' (as in [ˈandɛn] 'the duck') is analysed as a LHL sequence, and 'accent 2' (as in [ˈandɛn] 'the spirit') is analysed as HLHL, carrying an extra H tone, which is assumed to be lexical, whilst LOOK UP WHAT EXACTLY THE OTHER TONES MEAN. This analysis has significant explanatory power: it unifies 'tonal accent' with other prosodic phenomena such as tone and intonation, correctly predicts that the realization of accentual contrasts depends on the intonational context, and makes specific predictions as to the relative markedness of the members of the opposition. On the latter point, in the Central Swedish case the assumption is that 'accent 2' is the more marked pole of the contrast, since it carries a lexical tone. This is consistent with the fact that when accentual oppositions are neutralized (notably in monosyllables), it is only 'accent 1' that is possible in that language&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div> More recently, however, metrical alternatives to the tonal approach have been proposed. The general idea is that the tonal contrasts are surface correlates of a more abstract metrical opposition between the accents, such as two different types of feet, the placement of grid marks indicating different locations of metrical prominence, or syllable counts. These diverse structures then affect the association of predictable, post-lexical tones.</div><div>For Franconian, Carlos Gussenhoven and collaborators have proposed to analyze the tone-accent opposition as a privative lexical tone contrast. Their central analytical claim is that Accent 2 has a lexical tone, which then combines with intonational tones on the surface. Accent 1 is the default realization, that is, all tones are intonational. Take Take Cologne Franconian as example: Gussenhoven &amp; Peters (2004) and Peters (2006) analyze the system with a lexical tone on the first mora of Accent 2&nbsp;Franconian as example: Gussenhoven &amp; Peters (2004) and Peters (2006) analyze the system with a lexical tone T<sub>lex</sub> on the first mora of Accent 2. The surface value of T<sub>lex&nbsp;</sub>is determined by the following intonational tone; that is, it always copies the value of that tone. In declaratives, where the intonational pitch accent is H*L, the lexical tone will be realized as H<sub>lex</sub> because of the following H*; in interrogatives, where the pitch accent is L*H, it will be realized as Llex</div><div></div><div>       </div>
