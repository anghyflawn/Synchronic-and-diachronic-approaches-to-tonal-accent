<div>The proposed volume will consist of a diverse set of full papers and shorter ‘comment’ papers. The full  papers report original research that speaks to the questions outlined above, or evaluate current theoretical debates; the 'comment' papers outline the contributions of the individual papers to debates of general theoretical interest, and/or identify potential tensions and directions for further research that are necessary to develop and evaluate the arguments. Our proposed set of contributors therefore contains both scholars with a history of specialist, empirically driven engagement with ‘European’ tone accent systems and established experts in prosodic typology more generally. It is to be hoped that this structure will make the arguments around the analysis of ‘European’ tonal accent systems more accessible to non-specialists and bring home their general import, and at the same time allow those working in this area to position their research with respect to prosodic typology more generally.</div>
