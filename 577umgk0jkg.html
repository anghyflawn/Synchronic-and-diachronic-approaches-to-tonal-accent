<div>Draga Zec and Elisabeth Zsiga consider the interaction of accentual specification with intonation in three Neo-Å¡tokavian dialects of Serbian. They argue that not all intonational melodies interact with accentual specification in the same way: whilst intonational pitch accents are able to override lexical accentual specification, the interaction of lexical accent and boundary tones is more fine-grained. In this instance, the lexical specification show an affinity with prototypically tonal entities, which may suggest they are accessible to the tonal phonology of the language.</div>
