<div>The study of tonal accent is at the heart of current debates on the synchronic and diachronic typology of prosodic representations, one the most controversial fields in contemporary phonological theory. This volume, which offers a selection of original papers by leading scholars in the field, serves two goals. First, it presents and evaluates the current state of research, laying out the issues clearly for the benefit of scholars who are not specialists in the study of the respective languages, and highlights how the study of tonal accent speaks to some of the most important questions in phonological theory more generally. Second, it opens perspectives for future research, both by bringing in empirical data (both new and underused) and by contextualizing the research traditions specific to individual languages or groups within the more general theoretical debates, opening up the way for new insights. We expect this  volume to be particulatfor experts working on prosodic phonology, as well as for a broader academic audience (including advanced students) that would like to receive an introduction to the field in general, and to current debates in particular.</div><h1 data-label="982570" class="ltx_title_section">Tonal accent</h1>
