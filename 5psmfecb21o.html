<h2 data-label="634398" class="ltx_title_subsection"><b>The debates – diachrony</b></h2><div>Similar to debates concerning synchronic representations, we are still far from reaching a consensus on the diachronic paths that can lead to the emergence of tonal accent.</div><div>It is probably common ground that  tonal contrasts in tone accent languages ultimately emerge from non-contrastive pitch differences that at some stage are purely intonational, but are later reinterpreted as lexically distinctive tonal or metrical contrasts. On the basis of this uncontroversial assumption, there has been intensive debate as to the presence and role of segmental and durational influences on pitch in the genesis of tonal accents, how word-prosodic representations can be reconstructed in order to resolve ‘undesirable’ metrical representations that may have arisen through language change, or whether language contact has played a role in the developments in question.</div><div>These debates are closely intertwined with many of the synchronic issues outlined above. Since tonal accent is, generally, not reflected in spelling, the bulk of work on this area &nbsp;relies on the comparative method, taking the modern distribution of various kinds of prosodic system as the starting point. The reconstruction is thus closely informed by the empirical and theoretical work, and recent empirical advances in the study of tonal accent systems have also led to a reconsideration of diachronic hypotheses: for instance, the detailed study of the tonal accent system of the Franconian dialect of Arzbach has led&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{K_hnlein_2013}</cite>&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{K_hnlein_2015}</cite> to disavow the long-standing hypothesis that the&nbsp; was a diachronic wholesale ‘reversal’ of accent contours in certain Franconian varieties: as he shows, the Arzbach system shows reversed pitch contours compared to other varieties in declaratives,&nbsp; but not in interrogatives. Accordingly, there is no need to postulate a sound change that takes the rest of Franconian as the baseline and ‘flips’ the tonal contours.</div><div>Apart from such advances, the more fundamental issue of the origin of tonal accent remains controversial. In Baltic and Slavic the accents represent a development from the system of Proto-Indo-European. although the precise nature of the developments remain a classic problem (cf.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealt{Kim}</cite> for an overview); however, for Germanic the standard assumption in the literature is that they arose independently in North and West Germanic, most likely at some point during the Middle Ages. A common origin of the two respective oppositions seems unlikely because the lexical distributions of the oppositions differ substantially. This also provides the opportunity, however, to compare two arguably independent diachronic pathways to tonal accent in closely related languages to investigate similarities and differences. Independent of how exactly one reconstructs the development of the respective oppositions, a few fundamental similarities and differences can be established with certainty. For instance, it is clear that the notion 'syllable number' is crucial in the respective diachronic developments of the respective oppositions, although their relative importance of this notion differs. </div><div>That is, in both North and West Germanic, changes in the number of syllables have played an important role in the development of Accent 1 and Accent 2. In Scandinavian, original monosyllabic words always have Accent 1, independent of whether they are still monosyllabic or became disyllabic at some later point due to vowel epenthesis. For originally polysyllabic words, matters are a bit more complicated. These often have Accent 2, but not always; still, there is some correlation between polysyllabicity and Accent 2. Syllable number also features in the development of West Germanic tonal accent. For most types of words,  monosyllabicity implies the assignment of Accent 2, while original disyllables may or may not have Accent 1. This depends on the voicing quality of intervocalic consonants, where only intervocalic voiced consonants trigger Accent-1 assignment (in some areas, the assignment of Accent 1 is in such cases is furthermore contingent on apocope). While this generalization thus holds with certain patterns of variations, there is a specific group of words that always receives Accent 1, whether mono- or polysyllabic. This concerns words that had an originally long mid or low vowel in their stressed syllable. The bottom line is that in both North and West Germanic, prosodic factors like syllable number play an important role in understanding the development of tonal accent; yet the connection is arguably much more straightforward in North Germanic, while the West Germanic developments involve a complex interaction of various factors, including vowel and consonant quality and quantity).</div><div>Analyzing and comparing such distributional properties already gives us some insight into what factors can play a role in the emergence of tone accent systems; yet they do not  tell us how exactly the interplay of these factors leads to the emergence of tonal accent. As a matter of fact, this issue is unresolved for both areas, and substantially different theoretical accounts exist.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Summary North Germanic</div><div></div><div>For West Germanic, we essentially have an opposition between two approaches – one based on phonetic considerations that regards (intrinsic) durational differences between different groups of words as the sources of the opposition; see e.g.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Schmidt}</cite>&nbsp;and Boersma XXXX for proposals along these lines. Among themselves, however, these proposals in where they put the genesis of the opposition. Roughly, Schmidt thinks that the accents arose after apocope, but Boersma has argued that there are  distributional patterns in certain dialect areas for which that position cannot be upheld. Instead, he holds pitch-based epiphenomena&nbsp;open syllable lengthening responsible for the emergence of the accents. A substantially different reconstruction is the morphological approach by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Gussenhoven}</cite>. Essentially he suggests that the desire to retain a distinction between singulars and plurals led speakers to introduce a lexical tone, after a vowel-lengthening process threatened to remove the distinction between certain singular and plural forms. The contrast then spread through the lexicon on the basis of different principles, most strongly an interaction between intrinsic pitch height of vowels themselves (high vowels&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div>Independent the details of the proposals, such debatesoutline s</div><div></div><div>; yet the effects of syllable number interact with various segmental factors, such as vowel sonority and the voicing quality of intervocalic consonants. </div><div></div><div></div><div>seems crucial to assume that&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div>These issues are also of crucial relevance in analysing the synchronic typology of different varieties within a tone accent system – such as, for instance, which systems are ‘older’ than others. It is also notable that the type of tonal accent considered here is well represented in languages that, while not particularly closely related, broadly belong to the ‘Standard Average European’ type. This may obscure the fact that such patterns are something of a typological rarity: whilst not dissimilar ‘tonal accent’ systems have also been described for languages such as Basque, Japanese and Huariapano, there is still no consensus on whether these similarities between ‘European’ tonal accent systems can justifiably be seen as non-trivially similar.</div>
