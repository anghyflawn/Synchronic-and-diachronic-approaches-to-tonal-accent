<h2 data-label="634398" class="ltx_title_subsection"><b>The debates – diachrony</b></h2><div>Similar to debates concerning synchronic representations, we are still far from reaching a consensus on the diachronic paths that can lead to the emergence of tonal accent.&nbsp;It is probably common ground that  tonal contrasts in tone accent languages ultimately emerge from non-contrastive pitch differences that at some stage are purely intonational, but are later reinterpreted as lexically distinctive tonal or metrical contrasts. On the basis of this uncontroversial assumption, there has been intensive debate as to the presence and role of segmental and durational influences on pitch in the genesis of tonal accents, how word-prosodic representations can be reconstructed in order to resolve ‘undesirable’ metrical representations that may have arisen through language change, or whether language contact has played a role in the developments in question.</div><div>These debates are closely intertwined with many of the synchronic issues outlined above. Since tonal accent is, generally, not reflected in spelling, the bulk of work on this area &nbsp;relies on the comparative method, taking the modern distribution of various kinds of prosodic system as the starting point. The reconstruction is thus closely informed by the empirical and theoretical work, and recent empirical advances in the study of tonal accent systems have also led to a reconsideration of diachronic hypotheses: for instance, the detailed study of the tonal accent system of the Franconian dialect of Arzbach has led&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{K_hnlein_2013}</cite>&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{K_hnlein_2015}</cite> to disavow the long-standing hypothesis that there&nbsp; was a diachronic wholesale ‘reversal’ of accent contours in certain Franconian varieties: as he shows, the Arzbach system shows reversed pitch contours compared to other varieties in declaratives,&nbsp; but not in interrogatives. Accordingly, there is no need to postulate a sound change that takes the rest of Franconian as the baseline and ‘flips’ the tonal contours (see .&nbsp;Apart from such advances, the more fundamental issue of the origin of tonal accent remains controversial. In Baltic and Slavic the accents represent a development from the system of Proto-Indo-European. although the precise nature of the developments remain a classic problem (cf.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealt{Kim}</cite> for an overview). For Germanic, the standard assumption in the literature is that they arose independently in North and West Germanic, most likely at some point during the Middle Ages. A common origin of the two respective oppositions seems unlikely because the synchronic lexical distributions of the oppositions differ substantially. </div><div>Assuming that&nbsp;it is indeed  indeed  the case that the systems  developed independently, this provides us with the opportunity to identify and compare two  independent diachronic pathways to tonal accent in closely related languages. Independent of how exactly one reconstructs the development of the respective oppositions, a few distributional similarities and differences can be established with certainty. For instance, we know that the notion 'syllable number' is crucial in the   developments of both North Germanic and West Germanic tonal accent, although the relative impact of syllable structure differs.&nbsp;That is, in both North and West Germanic, changes in the number of syllables have played an important role in the genesis of the accent opposition. In North Germanic, original monosyllabic words always have Accent 1, independent of whether they are still monosyllabic or became disyllabic at some later point due to vowel epenthesis. Originally polysyllabic tend to have Accent 2, although the correlation seems somewhat less obvious and also depends on the still debated question when exactly the accent opposition arose.&nbsp;</div><div>The number of syllables of a given word also impacted the development of West Germanic tonal accent, but less strongly than in North Germanic. For most, but not all, types of words, original monosyllabicity implies the assignment of Accent 2, while original disyllables may or may not have Accent 1. The assignment of Accent 1 or Accent 2 in disyllables depends on the voicing quality of intervocalic consonants, where only words with intervocalic voiced consonants receive Accent 1  (in some areas, the assignment of Accent 1 is in such cases is furthermore contingent on apocope). Furthermore, there is a specific group of words that always receives Accent 1, whether mono- or polysyllabic – this concerns items that had an originally long mid or low vowel in their stressed syllable; such words thus go against the correlation of Accent 2 and monosyllabicity that can be established for other types of words. The bottom line is that in both North and West Germanic,  syllable number plays an important role in understanding the development of tonal accent; yet the connection is arguably  more straightforward in North Germanic than in West Germanic.</div><div>Analyzing and comparing such distributional properties of the two systems already gives us some insight into what factors can play a role in the emergence of tonal accent; yet of course this alone does not  tell us what exactly happened when the respective oppositions arose. As a matter of fact, this issue is unresolved for both areas, and substantially different scenarios have been proposed. Here, we will only provide the very basic tenets of some opposing approaches for North and West Germanic; they mainly serve to illustrate the challenges we face in the diachronic analysis of tone-accent oppositions.</div><div></div><div>Summary North Germanic</div><div></div><div>For West Germanic, we essentially have an opposition between two approaches – one based on phonetic considerations that regards (intrinsic) durational differences between different groups of words as the sources of the opposition; see e.g.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Schmidt}</cite>, Boersma XXXX and Köhnlein XXXX for proposals along these lines. These proposals differ, however, in where they locate the genesis of the 'phonemic' opposition. Roughly, Schmidt argues that the accents arose after apocope, but Boersma has argued that there are  distributional patterns in certain dialect areas for which that position cannot be upheld; Köhnlein does not take a strict position here, but he. Instead, he holds pitch-based epiphenomena&nbsp;open syllable lengthening responsible for the emergence of the accents. A substantially different reconstruction is the 'morphological' approach by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Gussenhoven}</cite>. Essentially, Gussenhoven suggests that the desire to retain a distinction between singulars and plurals led speakers to introduce a lexical tone, after a vowel-lengthening process threatened to remove the distinction between certain singular and plural forms. The contrast then spread through the lexicon on the basis of different principles, most strongly an interaction between intrinsic pitch height of vowels themselves (high vowels have higher intrinsic pitch than non-high vowels) and the pitch height assigned on the basis of the following consonants (voiced consonants correspond to lower pitch on preceding vowels, voiceless consonants correspond to higher pitch on preceding vowels).</div><div></div><div>Independent of the details of the respective proposals, such debates between vastly different proposals outline some of the most pressing issues that need to be addressed in diachronic research on tone accent oppositions, and possibly prosodic oppositions in general: it is a fact that each of the  theories proposed is grounded in attested data, and yet the proposed mechanisms and conclusions differ, sometimes drastically.&nbsp; This raises the question on how to evaluate the plausibility of a given reconstruction. Since we do not have any reliable manuscript evidence indicating how tonal accent was originally realized or even when it came into existence, any proposal have to be partially speculative. While it is certainly possible to compare the empirical coverage of opposing approaches, yet such (at least in principle) quantifiable patterns have to be compared against the number and type of assumptions that need to be reached to achieve the respective empirical coverage. That is, the question is how plausible a given explanation is, and the discussions in literature indicate that evaluating plausibility can be extremely difficult.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div>These issues are also of crucial relevance in analysing the synchronic typology of different varieties within a tone accent system – such as, for instance, which systems are ‘older’ than others. It is also notable that the type of tonal accent considered here is well represented in languages that, while not particularly closely related, broadly belong to the ‘Standard Average European’ type. This may obscure the fact that such patterns are something of a typological rarity: whilst not dissimilar ‘tonal accent’ systems have also been described for languages such as Basque, Japanese and Huariapano, there is still no consensus on whether these similarities between ‘European’ tonal accent systems can justifiably be seen as non-trivially similar.</div>
