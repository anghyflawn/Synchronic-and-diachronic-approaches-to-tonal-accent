<div>So far, these different approaches to the synchrony and diachrony of tone accent systems have never been evaluated in one volume, though there is much to say about these issues – all of which is directly relevant to central issues in prosodic phonology. For instance, metrical analyses of tonal accent can be considered more ‘abstract’ than the tonal approach. Th tonal analyses derive tonal accent directly from tonal specifications in the lexicon, whereas the relationship between tonal accent and phonological representation is indirect in metrical analyses, since it is mediated by metrical structure. On the other hand, tonal accent is sometimes accompanied by other phonetic / phonological correlates (such as duration or segmental effects); proponents of the metrical approach argue that such additional facts can often be expressed more straightforwardly within a metrical framework. Nevertheless, it is still not clear whether the claimed empirical advantages of the metrical approach, if real, should outweigh the increased abstractness of the analysis.</div>
