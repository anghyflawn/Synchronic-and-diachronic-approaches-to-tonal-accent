<ul><li>How do lexical and intonational tones interact with each other and with metrical structure (moras, syllables, feet, etc.)?</li><li>How surface-true should a phonological analysis of tonal accent be? How abstract can a phonological analysis of tonal accent be?</li><li>Outside of the tonal facts themselves, what counts as (synchronic) evidence in favor of a particular account of tonal accent, and what should be regarded as secondary (e.g. as phonetic enhancement, historical accidents, etc.)?</li><li>How can metrical prominence be reflected on the surface? Can metrical prominence (e.g. word stress) be contrastive at levels lower than the syllable?</li><li>What can we learn from tonal accent about the structure of prosodic systems / metrical representations?</li><li>How can tonal accent come into existence, and how can tone accent systems change over time? What factors favour or disfavour the rise of tonal accent systems?</li><li>What segmental, durational, intonational, and metrical correlates can play a role in determining the origin and lexical distribution of a tonal contrast, and what can this tell us about the interface between synchronic and diachronic phonology?<span class="author-d-iz88z86z86za0dz67zz78zz78zz74zz68zjz80zz71z9iz90z958z80zz68zjnecz68zy5pwz66zz76zz122zz88zjz82zz67zgupz122zf3z86zz80zhz122z"></span></li></ul>
