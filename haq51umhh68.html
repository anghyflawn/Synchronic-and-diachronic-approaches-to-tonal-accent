<div>Despite these succeses, an alternative to the tonal approach has been proposed more recently, which we shall call the&nbsp;<i>metrical</i> analysis. The general idea is that  tonal distinctions are surface correlates of a more 'abstract', metrical opposition between the accents, such as two different types of feet, the placement of grid marks indicating different locations of metrical prominence, or syllable counts. These diverse structures then affect the association of predictable, post-lexical tones: there are, however, no lexical tones associated with any morpheme underlyingly, which is what explicitly differentiates the metrical from the tonal approach. &nbsp;Again, we will turn to examples from Franconian and Scandinavian to briefly discuss some of the arguments that have been provided in favour of the approach. </div><div><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Morén-Duolljá2013}</cite>&nbsp;proposes a metrical analysis of the Central Swedish data discussed immediately above. In his account, the difference between 'accent 1' and 'accent 2' is largely predictable and follows from the default prosodification mechanism. In monosyllables, which can only carry 'accent 1', this mechanism can only build a monosyllabic foot consisting of a single, obligatorily heavy, syllable: (and)<sub>Ft</sub>&nbsp;'duck'. In considering polysyllabic words, however, Morén-Duolljá argues that the default prosodification builds a disyllabic, recursive foot headed by the stressed syllable: ((an)<sub>Ft</sub>de)<sub>Ft&nbsp;</sub>'spirit'. These different metrical structures are targeted by intonation-building rules that do not make specific reference to any tonal specification of individual morphemes: in the case of Central Swedish words in isolation, there are two boundary tones on the right edge of the word: H followed by a L. With a monosyllabic foot, these are the only tones in the word, giving the rising-falling melody of 'accent 1'. When a disyllabic, recursive foot is built, the intonation system also requires a HL boundary tone on its left edge; therefore, in words with such feet the tonal melody is HLHL — i.e. 'accent 2'.</div><div> This analysis provides a straightforward account for several important generalizations regarding the behaviour of Swedish tonal accent. For instance, the restriction of 'accent 2' to polysyllables follows without further stipulation. Another advantage is that polysyllables that demonstrate stress shift under suffixation have accent 2 (as in [<sup>2</sup>ˈmuːtur] 'engine', plural [mu<sup>2</sup>ˈtuːrɛr]), whereas polysyllables with accent 1 demonstrate no stress shift (as in [<sup>1</sup>ˈhɔbːʏ] 'hobby', plural [<sup>1</sup>ˈhɔbːʏɛr]). In Morén-Duolljá's analysis, both accent 2 and stress shift are produced by default metrification rules for polysyllables. Accent 1, on the other hand, cannot be derived by such default rules: instead, it reflects lexically specified metrical structure on the stressed syllable, faithfulness to which prevents both the construction of a disyllabic foot (i.e. it forces unpredictable 'accent 1') and stress shift. </div><div>Note, however, that in this account the markedness relationship between accent 1 and accent is reversed: despite appearing to have the simpler structure on the surface, it is accent 1 that needs special marking in the grammar — although it is worth noting that a similar conclusion was reached without the use of a metrical analysis by authors such as&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Lahiri2005}</cite>.</div><div>For Franconian, metrical analyses of the tone accent contrast have been proposed in, e.g., Hermans (2012), Köhnlein (2011, 2016), or Kehrein (2017?). Here, we sketch the basics of Köhnlein's approach; yet see Hermans' contribution in this volume for a comparison of Hermans' current approach and Köhnlein's proposal. Köhnlein proposes                                       that tonal accent derives from differences between two types of trochaic feet; he refers to Accent 1 as a  syllabic trochee, and Accent 2 as a moraic trochee. Accent 1,  the syllabic trochee, is headed by the&nbsp;syllable  node of the first syllable, whereas Accent 2 is headed by the first mora. Abstracting away from some  technical details of the proposal, this results in a different metrical strength of moras in the accent syllable: Accent 1 contains two strong moras because both are licensed by the foot head, the syllable node. Accent 2 contains one strong mora and one weak mora: the  first, strong&nbsp;mora is the foot head; the second, weak mora is the foot dependent. These differences in metrical strength then lead to different associations of postlexical tones and moras.&nbsp;For dialects of the Cologne type, Köhnlein claims that  only strong moras can have their own, independent tone. Accordingly, Accent-1 syllables (two strong moras) can have two tones (H*L in declaratives or L*H in interrogatives, respectively); Accent-2 syllables (one strong and one weak mora) can have one tone (H* or L*); the respective trailing tones have to be realized after the accent syllable. Köhnlein argues that additional phenomena found in Franconian dialects are in line with a metrical analysis of Franconian tonal accent, and with his analysis in particular: this  concerns differences in segmental quality and quantity as well as  morphological alternations, which, as Köhnlein claims, can  be analyzed more successfully in a metrical approach.</div><div>Broadly speaking, different metrical approaches to tonal accent share the same general insight that variety in the tonal association between the accents can be reduced to metrical differences, and that these metrical differences can have surface correlates other than tone. The detailed implementation of the approaches differs, however, be it with regard to competing analyses of one system, or across languages. That is, Hermans', Kehrein's and Köhnlein's analyses of Franconian differ from each other, and Morén-Duolljá's approach to Swedish is different from all other approaches. PLUS SOME EVALUATION OF THIS</div><div>The vitality of both of these approaches attests to the considerable empirical interest presented by the phenomenon of tonal accent. It has become increasingly clear  that the focus on tonal melodies in isolation has obscured many very important patterns of behaviour that are informative with respect to the proper analysis of tonal accent and its interaction with intonation. The following is just a selection of empirical questions that have only recently begun to be addressed for at least some varieties of 'tonal accent' languages:</div><ul><li>Interaction with wider intonational system: the differences in the realization of tonal accents in different contexts relative to polarity and placement with respect to the focus accent;</li><li>Differences in the behaviour of tonal accents in different domains; cf.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Myrberg_2015}</cite>, who show how tonal accents are assigned in Swedish at different levels of the prosodic hierarchy;</li><li>The behaviour of accentual and intonational tones in domains longer than the stressed syllable in a mono- or disyllabic word: for instance, if an accented syllable is separated from a phrase boundary by several unstressed syllables, do any of the accentual or boundary tones spread, or do they remain anchored to their source, and what are the consequences of this for the analysis <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Riad_2013,Hognestad2012}</cite>?</li></ul><div>Clarifying issues such as these is a priority if we are to better understand the functioning of tonal accents, and if we are to be able to distinguish empirically between the different approaches outlined above (or any new approaches that may be proposed in the future).</div><div>It is also imperative to broaden the empirical basis of the study of tonal accents beyond the ‘usual suspects’ within the Germanic group. As noted, in Europe alone tonal accent contrasts, or at least distinctions similar to them, are attested in languages as disparate as Serbo-Croatian, Slovenian, Scottish Gaelic, Basque, Latvian, Lithuanian, Livonian, and Estonian. For many of these languages, empirical data is simply not available at the kind of scale that has informed theoretical work on some of the Germanic varieties; in other cases, whilst the basic generalizations are long-established, the more nuanced approaches that allow us to disentangle the contribution of intonation and any lexical tones present have been under-utilized. In some cases — notably with respect to minoritized languages such as Basque and Scottish Gaelic — such empirical work is needed urgently.</div><div>A very important, and until recently quite overlooked, aspect of the issue of tonal accents is the interaction between pitch and other phenomena within the language, such as other suprasegmental patterns, consonant and vowel quantity, vowel quality, and segmental processes. Although an interplay between pitch and glottalization has long been recognized in the literature (particularly with respect to the relationship between Swedish and Norwegian tonal accents and Danish&nbsp;<i>stød</i>), other aspects often remain poorly understood. Within Germanic, such phenomena are manifest in Franconian (REFS), but also in Low German varieties, where pitch has been traditionally claimed to be involved in the realization of an alleged ternary quantitative distinction (‘overlength’; cf.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealt{Ternes1981,Kohler2001,Prehn2012}</cite>). Outside of Germanic, however, such interactions may be much more widespread, but they remain poorly studied. They present a particularly interesting test bed for the comparison of the ‘metrical’ and ‘tonal’ approaches: if the interactions are indeed real, then they must be accounted for, or else it must be shown that the mechanisms behind non-tonal alternations are not the same as those driving the tonal accents.</div><div>Apart from the intrinsic interest in the analysis of a relatively unusual phenomenon, tonal accents present some interesting challenges to phonological theory. What is the place of these systems in prosodic typology? Languages such as North Germanic and Franconian are often said to sit rather uneasily in the widely used dichotomy between ‘tone languages’ and ‘stress languages’, and in fact&nbsp;&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Hyman2009}</cite> has argued that the category of ‘pitch accent languages’ is not a coherent one. Relatedly, how common are the kinds of contrasts we observe in European languages? Many of the examples discussed here are often viewed as ‘textbook cases’, but does this Eurocentric view obscure the typological unusualness of the system? Or, conversely, do the insights gained from both the metrical and the tonal approach to European accents extend to other languages (cf. Köhnlein to appear on Uspanteko)?</div><div>The contrast between the ‘tonal’ and ‘metrical’ approaches to tonal accents also speaks to one of the foundational questions of phonological theory, namely that of abstractness. The tonal analysis is relatively concrete: its starting point is the observable, surface representation that involves pitch distinctions, and it is assumed that they are produced from underlying representations that are similar in kind — they are also tonal — mostly using mechanisms familiar from other areas of phonology. The metrical analysis, on the other hand, is much more abstract: the postulated underlying distinctions cannot easily be observed on the surface, and their very existence, not to mention their properties, can only be inferred from their effects on pitch (and also, perhaps, on other phonological phenomena). Within the framework of this abstract analysis, space is created for the use of fairly elaborate representational devices, such as recursion of metrical constituents, (e.g. feet), or contrast in the placement of metrical prominence within the syllable. Indeed, in an abstract approach the very foundational terms of metrical phonology such as ‘stress’, ‘prominence’, or ‘accent’ become problematized&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{van_der_Hulst_2012}</cite>: does prominence correspond to stress, or can it be created independently of stress by other means? What is the relationship between lexicalized accents and intonational tones, or indeed between different kinds of lexical accents? Is ‘stress’ a coherent or useful category in tonal accent languages? The abandonment of relatively surface-bound representations also raises questions with regard to the status of notions such as markedness: w</div><div> On the other hand, more abstract approaches hold out the promise of providing unified analyses for a range of related phenomena within a single language, sometimes both supra- and subsegmental, without mediation by tone, which may or may not be easily achieved within more surface-oriented accounts. This balance between naturalness and explanatory power is a very familiar problem in phonological theory, and the study of tonal accent can make important contributions to progress in this area.</div><div></div>
