<div>Despite these succeses, an alternative to the tonal approach has been proposed more recently, which we shall call the&nbsp;<i>metrical</i> analysis. The general idea is that  tonal distinctions are surface correlates of a more 'abstract', metrical opposition between the accents, such as two different types of feet, the placement of grid marks indicating different locations of metrical prominence, or syllable counts. These diverse structures then affect the association of predictable, post-lexical tones: there are, however, no lexical tones associated with any morpheme underlyingly, which is what explicitly differentiates the metrical from the tonal approach. &nbsp;Again, we will turn to examples from Franconian and Scandinavian to briefly discuss some of the arguments that have been provided in favour of the approach. </div><div><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Morén-Duolljá2013}</cite>&nbsp;proposes a metrical analysis of the Central Swedish data discussed immediately above. In his account, the difference between 'accent 1' and 'accent 2' is largely predictable and follows from the default prosodification mechanism. In monosyllables, which can only carry 'accent 1', this mechanism can only build a monosyllabic foot consisting of a single, obligatorily heavy, syllable: (and)<sub>Ft</sub>&nbsp;'duck'. In considering polysyllabic words, however, Morén-Duolljá argues that the default prosodification builds a disyllabic, recursive foot headed by the stressed syllable: ((an)<sub>Ft</sub>de)<sub>Ft&nbsp;</sub>'spirit'. These different metrical structures are targeted by intonation-building rules that do not make specific reference to any tonal specification of individual morphemes: in the case of Central Swedish words in isolation, there are two boundary tones on the right edge of the word: H followed by a L. With a monosyllabic foot, these are the only tones in the word, giving the rising-falling melody of 'accent 1'. When a disyllabic, recursive foot is built, the intonation system also requires a HL boundary tone on its left edge; therefore, in words with such feet the tonal melody is HLHL — i.e. 'accent 2'.</div><div> This analysis provides a straightforward account for several important generalizations regarding the behaviour of Swedish tonal accent. For instance, the restriction of 'accent 2' to polysyllables follows without further stipulation. Another advantage is that polysyllables that demonstrate stress shift under suffixation have accent 2 (as in [<sup>2</sup>ˈmuːtur] 'engine', plural [mu<sup>2</sup>ˈtuːrɛr]), whereas polysyllables with accent 1 demonstrate no stress shift (as in [<sup>1</sup>ˈhɔbːʏ] 'hobby', plural [<sup>1</sup>ˈhɔbːʏɛr]). In Morén-Duolljá's analysis, both accent 2 and stress shift are produced by default metrification rules for polysyllables. Accent 1, on the other hand, cannot be derived by such default rules: instead, it reflects lexically specified metrical structure on the stressed syllable, faithfulness to which prevents both the construction of a disyllabic foot (i.e. it forces unpredictable 'accent 1') and stress shift. </div><div>Note, however, that in this account the markedness relationship between accent 1 and accent is reversed: despite appearing to have the simpler structure on the surface, it is accent 1 that needs special marking in the grammar — although it is worth noting that a similar conclusion was reached without the use of a metrical analysis by authors such as&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Lahiri2005}</cite>.</div><div>For Franconian, metrical analyses of the tone accent contrast have been proposed in, e.g., Hermans (2012), Köhnlein (2011, 2016), or Kehrein (2017?). Here, we sketch the basics of Köhnlein's approach; yet see Hermans' contribution in this volume for a comparison of Hermans' current approach and Köhnlein's proposal. Köhnlein proposes                                       that tonal accent derives from differences between two types of trochaic feet; he refers to Accent 1 as a  syllabic trochee, and Accent 2 as a moraic trochee. Accent 1,  the syllabic trochee, is headed by the&nbsp;syllable  node of the first syllable, whereas Accent 2 is headed by the first mora. Abstracting away from some  technical details of the proposal, this results in a different metrical strength of moras in the accent syllable: Accent 1 contains two strong moras because both are licensed by the foot head, the syllable node. Accent 2 contains one strong mora and one weak mora: the  first, strong&nbsp;mora is the foot head; the second, weak mora is the foot dependent. These differences in metrical strength then lead to different associations of postlexical tones and moras.&nbsp;For dialects of the Cologne type, Köhnlein claims that  only strong moras can have their own, independent tone. Accordingly, Accent-1 syllables (two strong moras) can have two tones (H*L in declaratives or L*H in interrogatives, respectively); Accent-2 syllables (one strong and one weak mora) can have one tone (H* or L*); the respective trailing tones have to be realized after the accent syllable. Köhnlein argues that additional phenomena found in Franconian dialects are in line with a metrical analysis of Franconian tonal accent, and with his analysis in particular: this  concerns differences in segmental quality and quantity as well as  morphological alternations, which, as Köhnlein claims, can  be analyzed more successfully in a metrical approach.</div><div>Broadly speaking, different metrical approaches to tonal accent share the same general insight that variety in the tonal association between the accents can be reduced to metrical differences, and that these metrical differences can have surface correlates other than tone. The detailed implementation of the approaches differs, however, be it with regard to competing analyses of one system, or across languages. That is, Hermans', Kehrein's and Köhnlein's analyses of Franconian differ from each other, and Morén-Duolljá's approach to Swedish is different from all other approaches. PLUS SOME EVALUATION OF THIS</div><div>The vitality of both of these approaches attests to the considerable empirical interest presented by the phenomenon of tonal accent. It has become increasingly clear  that the focus on tonal melodies in isolation has obscured many very important patterns of behaviour that are informative with respect to the proper analysis of tonal accent and its interaction with intonation.
