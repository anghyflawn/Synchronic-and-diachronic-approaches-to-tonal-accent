<div></div><div>      &nbsp;More recently, however, an alternative to the tonal approach have been proposed, which will shall call the&nbsp;<i>metrical</i> analysis. The general idea is that the tonal distinctions are surface correlates of a more abstract metrical opposition between the accents, such as two different types of feet, the placement of grid marks indicating different locations of metrical prominence, or syllable counts. These diverse structures then affect the association of predictable, post-lexical tones: there are, however, no lexical tones associated with any morpheme underlyingly. Thus,&nbsp;&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Morén-Duolljá2013}</cite>&nbsp;proposes a metrical analysis of the Central Swedish data discussed immediately above. In his account, the difference between 'accent 1' and 'accent 2' is largely predictable: 'accent 2' arises via the default prosodification mechanism, which builds a disyllabic, recursive foot headed by the (obligatorily heavy) stressed syllable: ((CVX)<sub>Ft</sub>CV)<sub>Ft</sub>, whereas 'accent 1' reflects a non-recursive foot consisting of a single (heavy) syllable .</div>
