<div>Despite these succeses, an alternative to the tonal approach has been proposed more recently, which we shall call the&nbsp;<i>metrical</i> analysis. The general idea is that the tonal distinctions are surface correlates of a more 'abstract', metrical opposition between the accents, such as two different types of feet, the placement of grid marks indicating different locations of metrical prominence, or syllable counts. These diverse structures then affect the association of predictable, post-lexical tones: there are, however, no lexical tones associated with any morpheme underlyingly, which is what explicitly differentiates the metrical from the tonal approach. &nbsp;Again, we will turn to examples from Franconian and Scandinavian to briefly discuss some of the arguments that have been provided in favor of the approach. </div><div>For instance, &nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Morén-Duolljá2013}</cite>&nbsp;proposes a metrical analysis of the Central Swedish data discussed immediately above. In his account, the difference between 'accent 1' and 'accent 2' is largely predictable: 'accent 2' arises via the default prosodification mechanism, which builds a disyllabic, recursive foot headed by the (obligatorily heavy) stressed syllable: ((CVX)<sub>Ft</sub>CV)<sub>Ft</sub>, whereas 'accent 1' reflects a non-recursive foot consisting of a single (heavy) syllable. These different metrical structures are targeted by intonation-building rules that do not make specific reference to any tonal specification of individual morphemes: in the case of Central Swedish words in isolation, the relevant tones are L at the right edge of an intonational phrase, a H at the right edge of a smaller constituent described as the 'accent phrase', and a HL at the left edge of a non-maximal foot. What this means is that where a word contains a recursive foot, the tonal melody is HLHL, whereas for words with a monosyllabic head foot the melody is a HL in the post-stressed syllable — essentially the usual analysis for 'accent 2' vs. 'accent 1' in this variety. This analysis provides a straightforward account for several important generalizations regarding the behaviour of Swedish tonal accent. For instance, the restriction of 'accent 2' to polysyllables follows without further stipulation, since monosyllables simply do not have the segmental content to construct a disyllabic foot. Another advantage is that polysyllables that demonstrate stress shift under suffixation have accent 2 (as in [<sup>2</sup>ˈmuːtur] 'engine', plural [mu<sup>2</sup>ˈtuːrɛr]), whereas polysyllables with accent 1 demonstrate no stress shift (as in [<sup>1</sup>ˈhɔbːʏ] 'hobby', plural [<sup>1</sup>ˈhɔbːʏɛr]). In Morén-Duolljá's analysis, this is due to both accent 2 and stress shift being the outcome of default metrification rules applying in polysyllables. Accent 1, on the other hand, cannot be derived by such default rules, and is instead analysed as reflecting a lexically specified metrical structure on the stressed syllable. The existence of this underlying monosyllabic foot that remains untouched by the default rules explains both the appearance of accent 1 rather than the default accent 2, and the lack of stress shift. Note, however, that in this account the markedness relationship between accent 1 and accent is reversed compared to the tonal analysis: despite appearing to have the simpler structure on the surface, it is accent 1 that needs special reference in the grammar — although it is worth noting that a similar conclusion was reached without the use of a metrical analysis by authors such as&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Lahiri2005}</cite>.</div><div>For Franconian, metrical analyses of the tone accent contrast have been proposed in, e.g., Hermans (2012), Köhnlein (2011, 2016), or Kehrein (2017?). Here, we sketch the basics of Köhnlein's approach; yet see Hermans' contribution in this volume for a comparison of Hermans' current approach and Köhnlein's proposal. Köhnlein proposes&nbsp;                                        that tonal accent derives from types of trochaic feet: Accent 1 is a  syllabic trochee, and Accent 2 is a moraic trochee (the general concepts of  syllabic and moraic trochees go back to Hayes 1995; see Smith, this volume, for  a more detailed discussion of foot structure in Germanic). The head of Accent 1,  the syllabic trochee, is the <i>syllable</i>  node, which dominates both moras in the accent syllable. Köhnlein assumes that  being linked to the foot head makes these two moras metrically ‘strong’. In  Figure 4, this is represented with two superscript pluses (µ+). The  head of Accent 2, the moraic trochee, is not the syllable node but the first  mora of the accent syllable; the second mora is the foot dependent. Therefore, only  the first mora is metrically strong (µ+), but the second mora, which  is not linked to a foot head, is weak (µ-).</div><div>    </div><div>For Rule A dialects (such as Cologne), Köhnlein assumes that  only strong moras can receive their ‘own’ tone. Therefore, in Accent 2, the metrically  strong first mora can license a tone while the weak second mora cannot support  its own tone. Instead, the tone from the first mora will spread to the second  mora, which results in a high level tone in declaratives, and a low level tone  in interrogatives (the trailing tone are realized after the accent syllable,  similar to the tonal approach). In Accent 1, each of the two moras in the tone  accent syllable is strong, so each can license its own tone. Therefore, both tones  (H*L in declaratives, L*H in interrogatives) can be realized in the accent  syllable, leading to a falling and a rising tone, respectively. </div><div>            </div>
