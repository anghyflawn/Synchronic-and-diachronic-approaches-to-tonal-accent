<div>The notion ‘tonal accent’ (also ‘pitch accent’, ‘word tone’) is commonly used to characterize prosodic systems that show tonal contrasts but limit them to syllables with word stress (typically only primary stress). Typically, we find privative oppositions between two tone accents, which are often referred to as Accent 1 and Accent 2. Tonal accent is found in, for instance, Franconian (spoken in parts of Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands), Latvian, Lithuanian, North Germanic (Norwegian, Swedish, some Danish dialects), Scottish Gaelic, and Serbo-Croatian. A famous accent minimal pair from Swedish is the opposition between [1andən] ‘the duck’ versus [2andən] ‘the spirit’. On the surface, the two items are segmentally identical, but differ tonally. In Stockholm Swedish, [1andən] (superscript 1 = Accent 1) is pronounced with a rising-falling (LHL) contour in isolation; [2andən] (Accent 2) has an additional high pitch target at the beginning of the stressed syllable (HLHL), and the rise-fall part occurs later than in Accent 1.</div>
