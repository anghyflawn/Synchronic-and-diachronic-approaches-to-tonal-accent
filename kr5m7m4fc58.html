<div>Several papers in the volume address the issue of the relationship between relatively abstract, discrete ‘tonal’ or ‘accentual’ specifications and their phonetic implementation. Anna Daugavet’s account of the phonetic realization of these contrasts in the Baltic languages underscores the phonetically versatile nature of the accentual distinctions, which are associated not just with prosodic cues such as pitch, duration, intensity, and voice quality, but also segmental phenomena such as laryngeal assimilation and diachronic change of vowel quality. The complex nature of these interactions forces a reconsideration of the extent to which phonetic detail can, and should, be accommodated within a traditional autosegmental-metrical framework that privileges pitch, in the shape of grammatical tone, as the main exponent of accentual distinctions. </div><div>The issue of how abstract these representations are is also addressed by José Ignacio Hualde and Ander Beristain, who investigate the realization of stress in non-tonal Standard Basque by speakers of tonal dialects. They argue that the patterns of the assignment of stress and accent are systematically distinct in the different varieties, and their speakers are bidialectal, manipulating different grammatical systems. The phonetic patterns of the expression of prominence, on the other hand, show more permeability between the standard language and the dialects, raising further questions about the nature of phonological representation of accents vs. its phonetic implementation.&nbsp;</div>
