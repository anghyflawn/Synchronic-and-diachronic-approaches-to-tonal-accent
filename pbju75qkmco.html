<div>A  more indirect approach to lexical accentual specification is offered in the paper by Ben Hermans. He considers another classic case of tonal accent — the prosodic system of Limburgian varieties &nbsp;— and argues that the difference between ‘Accent 1’ and ‘Accent 2’ is best analysed as one of underlying specified metrical structure (in particular feet). Hermans argues that his proposal is consistent with both the prosodic facts themselves and certain segmental patterns dependent on tonal accent specifications, which, he argues, are difficult to explain under a tonal accent.</div>
