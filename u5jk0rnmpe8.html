<div>Similar to debates concerning synchronic representations, we are still far from reaching a consensus on the diachronic paths that can lead to the emergence of tonal accent.</div><div>It is probably common ground that  tonal contrasts in tone accent languages ultimately emerge from non-contrastive pitch differences that at some stage are purely intonational, but are later reinterpreted as lexically distinctive tonal or metrical contrasts. On the basis of this uncontroversial assumption, there has been intensive debate as to the presence and role of segmental and durational influences on pitch in the genesis of tonal accents, how word-prosodic representations can be reconstructed in order to resolve ‘undesirable’ metrical representations that may have arisen through language change, or whether language contact has played a role in the developments in question.</div><div>These debates are closely intertwined with many of the synchronic issues outlined above. Since tonal accent is, generally, not reflected in spelling, the bulk of work on this area &nbsp;relies on the comparative method, taking the modern distribution of various kinds of prosodic system as the starting point. The reconstruction is thus closely informed by the empirical and theoretical work, and recent empirical advances in the study of tonal accent systems have also led to a reconsideration of diachronic hypotheses: for instance, the detailed study of the tonal accent system of the Franconian dialect of Arzbach has led&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{K_hnlein_2013}</cite>&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{K_hnlein_2015}</cite> to disavow the long-standing hypothesis that the&nbsp; was a diachronic wholesale ‘reversal’ of accent contours in certain Franconian varieties: as he shows, the Arzbach system shows reversed pitch contours compared to other varieties in declaratives,&nbsp; but not in interrogatives. Accordingly, there is no need to postulate a sound change that takes the rest of Franconian as the baseline and ‘flips’ the tonal contours.</div><div>Apart from such advances, the more fundamental issue of the origin of tonal accent remains controversial. In Baltic and Slavic the accents represent a development from the system of Proto-Indo-European. although the precise nature of the developments remain a classic problem (cf.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealt{Kim}</cite> for an overview); however, for Germanic the standard assumption in the literature is that they arose independently in North and West Germanic, most likely at some point during the Middle Ages. A common origin of the two respective oppositions seems unlikely because the lexical distributions of the oppositions differ substantially. For North Germanic, it seems uncontroversial to assume that differences between changes in syllable number is connected</div><div></div><div>seems crucial to assume that&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div>These issues are also of crucial relevance in analysing the synchronic typology of different varieties within a tone accent system – such as, for instance, which systems are ‘older’ than others. It is also notable that the type of tonal accent considered here is well represented in languages that, while not particularly closely related, broadly belong to the ‘Standard Average European’ type. This may obscure the fact that such patterns are something of a typological rarity: whilst not dissimilar ‘tonal accent’ systems have also been described for languages such as Basque, Japanese and Huariapano, there is still no consensus on whether these similarities between ‘European’ tonal accent systems can justifiably be seen as non-trivially similar.</div>
