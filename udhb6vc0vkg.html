<div>The papers collected in this part of the book all address issues that have not been at the forefront of diachronic debates connected to tone accent, which have largely focused on competing theories of how the accentual distinctions arose in the different languages. Patrik Bye proposes a scenario to explain the emergence of vowel allophony in Central Scandinavian varieties as an interaction of the alignment of intonational tones, syllable weight, and articulatory constraints on the realization of pitch. Roibeard Ã“ Maolalaigh and Pavel Iosad consider evidence from both Irish and Scottish Gaelic dialects to show how accentual contrasts, and several related prosodic and segmental phenomena, arise from changes in the timing of intonational tones. Both of these papers focus on diachronic accentual developments as involving changes in timing relationships within a metrical domain, thereby tending to the abstract side of the representational debate.&nbsp;</div>
